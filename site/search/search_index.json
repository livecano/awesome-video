You'll deliver noticeably higher quality video if you follow the advice detailed below. Encoding-for-HEVC - Eyevinn/docker-hevc - Docker container to create HEVC streaming packages - Eyevinn/docker-hevc Guide to HEVC/H.265 Encoding and Playback - HEVC's main advantage over H.264 is that it offers roughly double the compression ratio for the same quality. This means that a video file encoded with HEVC can occupy half the space of its H.264 equivalent with no noticeable change in quality, or the same amount of space with improved quality. HEVC in HLS: 10 Key Questions for Streaming Video Developers - Many who heard that Apple is adding support for HEVC playback in HTTP Live Streaming were left with more questions than answers.

You'll deliver noticeably higher quality video if you follow the advice detailed below. Encoding-for-HEVC - Eyevinn/docker-hevc - Docker container to create HEVC streaming packages - Eyevinn/docker-hevc Guide to HEVC/H.265 Encoding and Playback - HEVC's main advantage over H.264 is that it offers roughly double the compression ratio for the same quality.
